# Mathematical
A F#-based library for functions used in solving Project Euler problems along with some basic statistical functions.
A library for functions used in solving Project Euler problems along with some basic statistical functions, coded in F# 

The Project Euler functions cover primes, factorials, narcissism, random numbers, arrays and series/sequences (collatz, terra, Fibonacci). 

The statistical functions cover variance, standard deviation, and sum of squares.
